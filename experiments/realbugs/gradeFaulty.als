Alloy gradebook spec, with some names changed:
Each relation is now denoted by (i) using an appropriate legal English verb-phrase, then
(ii)  eliding "is" is for concision. 
This facilitates matching English translation to spec.

Also: rephrased assertion as an implication.

The specification
-----------------

We consider 3 classes:

- Persons
- Classes
- Assignments

The class of Persons is partitioned into 2 non-overlapping subclasses:

- Students
- Professors

We make the following assumptions:

1. For each Class there is a single Professor who is the instructor_of it.

2. For each Class there is a set of Students who are the assistants_for it.

3. For each Assignment there is a single Class associated_with it

4. For each Assignment there is a set of Students assigned_to it.

5. A Person can_grade an Assignment only if either the
    person is an assistant_for the  Class associated_with the Assignment
    or the Person is the Professor who is the instructor_of that
    Class.

The assertion
--------------
 
Here is the assertion that we thought would be true:

* There cannot exist a Person who is allowed to grade an Assignment
  asigned_to them.


--------------------------------------------------------------

Notes/Qs
----------

Why was the PolicyAllowsGrading specified as a pred rather than a
fact?   If a fact then NoOneCanGradeTheirOwnAssignment 
is easier to state.
