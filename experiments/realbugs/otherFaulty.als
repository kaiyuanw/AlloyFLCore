/*
The specification
-----------------

We consider 3 classes:
- Persons
- Groups
- Rooms

There are two groups in particular: the systems and logic groups. 
There is one room in particular: the secure_lab.

We make the following assumptions:

1. Each person is a member_of some Group.

2. For each Room there is a set of Groups that are located_in it.

3. At least, the systems and logic groups are located_in the secure_lab.

4. A Person can_enter a Room only if the Person is a member_of a Group located_in the Room.

The assertion
--------------
 
Here is the assertion that we thought would be true:

* Each person that can_enter the secure_lab is a member_of the logic or the systems Group.
